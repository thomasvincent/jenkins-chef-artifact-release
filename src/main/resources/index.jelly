<div>
    Provides 2 separate functionalities:
    Build Parameter: Provides a new build parameter type : 'List Chef environments' allowing the user to retrieve the list of
    available Chef environments in a drop down list;
    <br/>
    Build wrapper: Given an environment build parameter/variable and one or more parameters specifying the artifacts you want to deploy, will save these in a data bag item along with some more information about the status of the build.<br/>
    The data bag item will be updated twice: when the job starts and when it finishes.<br/>
    Environment report page will be generated showing 'what got deployed where'.
